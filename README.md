# Active Directory Virtual Lab

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment and management of an Active Directory (AD) environment in a virtual lab. It includes setting up a domain controller, configuring DNS, managing users and groups, implementing Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and integrating a client machine.

## Objectives
- Deploy a domain controller using Windows Server.
- Configure DNS for name resolution.
- Administer users, groups, and organizational units.
- Implement and test Group Policy Objects.
- Integrate a client machine into the domain.

## Tools and Resources
- **Windows Server ISO:** Evaluation version from Microsoft.
- **Virtualization Software:** VMware Workstation (or VirtualBox/Hyper-V).
- **Hardware Requirements:** Minimum 8 GB RAM, 50 GB storage.
- **Operating System for Client Machines:** Windows 10/11 (optional).

## Features
1. Fully functional Active Directory domain.
2. Properly configured DNS with forward and reverse lookup zones.
3. Organizational Units for logical resource management.
4. Group Policy Objects for enforcing security and user settings.
5. Integrated client machine for testing domain functionality.

## Key Learnings
- Centralized management with Active Directory.
- Importance of DNS in domain environments.
- Role of GPOs in securing and standardizing systems.
- Troubleshooting and testing AD environments.
